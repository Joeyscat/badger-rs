/// as determined by the `valid` method.
/// An iterator is valid if it is currently "pointing" to a key/value pair.

/// must be called before beginning iteration.
/// Iterators may become invalid after a failed `seek`,
/// or after iteration has ended after calling `next` or `prev`,
/// and they return `false`.
